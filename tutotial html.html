    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>

    <p>
        In this unit, I want to learn how to build websites using HTML and CSS.<br>
        Iâ€™m also interested in understanding how web pages are structured and displayed in a browser.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope to gain hands-on experience with coding and become comfortable writing my own web pages from scratch.
